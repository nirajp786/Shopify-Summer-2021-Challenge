# Shopify-Summer-2021-Challenge 
This is the image repository that I have created for the Shopify 2021 Challenge. For the image repository I decided to go with a graphical user interface approach and proceeded to use Python as the main language, Tkinter for GUI, PostgreSQL for the database and various other libraries as well. Below I have attached some screenshot of the application and some of its features.

## Application
When launching the application user will be presenting with the following screen:

## Adding a Picture
If a user would like to add picture they would click on the Add Image and a window would pop up which would allow them to select their pictures to upload

After adding the picture it would automatically refresh and show the the images that are uploaded to the database.

### Hover Over a Picture
Hovering over a picture will allow them the user to see the details of the picture. Such as the id, the name, and the date added.

Let's Add another picture as well :D
As you can see right after adding the second picture it is displayed right away

## Addtional Functionality
We can also right-click on the photo that we are hovering over and we can either delete the picture or update the picture with another picture.

### Updating the Picture
Here we choose the update picture and we get asked to select another picture to be used as the new picture

As you can see the second picture that we uploaded is now updated with this new picture.

# Thank you
## Thank you for considering me for the position and giving me the oppurtunity to present my skill.
Like I said in the application I have a true passion for software development, I believe we can shape the world how we want with technology.
